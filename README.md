There are some additional subjects mentioned by [Sipser's last course](https://youtu.be/eEXSv0jChO4?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60_JNv2MmK3wkOt9syvfQWY&t=4696):
- MIT 6.841/18.405 Advanced Complexity Theory
- [MIT 6.875 Foundations of Cryptography](http://mit6875.org/) - [Spring 2018 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ogFv-ieghe8MOIcpD6UDtdK-UMHG8oH) - [Fall 2021 videos](https://vimeo.com/user150298776)
- [MIT 6.842 Randomness and Computation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/COURSE/S22/)

Except for MIT 6.875, the rest of the courses don't seem to have public videos, if you find them, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know.
